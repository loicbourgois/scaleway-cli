Bootscripts are a combination of a [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) and of an [initrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk).
They tell to the instance how to start and configure its starting process and settings.

Bootscripts are available on all of instances types (DEV, GP, RENDER, ARM).

Scaleway recommends that you take the "localboot" boot method that will automatically launch your instance with your locally installed kernel.
It gives you full control over the booting process of your instance.

Scaleway also provides a "rescue" bootscript that can be used when your instance gets a failure and if you need a clean operating system to access your data.
